The best is to use the ImGTA mod to check all these in game!

# Global variables for the version 372
There are a bunch of global variables that are easily accesible and can provide useful information, this file lists addresses to some variables that could be useful.
You can find the matching address for another game version if you decompile it and compare with this version (compare two scripts that use it).

# List of potentially useful addresses:

* Audio name (string): 0x3BCCF
* Audio source (string): 0x3D92
* Dialogue state (int): 0x3D4C
* Mission state (int): 0x15F6A
* Death name (string): 0x10B7D
* Player switch locations array (guess): 0x14D9D
    Each element has two location (x,y,z) that match some switches
